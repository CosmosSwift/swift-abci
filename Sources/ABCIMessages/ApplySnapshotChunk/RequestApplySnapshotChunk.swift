/// The application can choose to refetch chunks and/or ban P2P peers as appropriate.

/// The application may want to verify each chunk, e.g. by attaching chunk hashes in `Snapshot.
/// metadata` and/or incrementally verifying contents against `appHash`.
///
/// When all chunks have been accepted, Tendermint will make an ABCI `Info` call to verify that
/// `lastBlockAppHash` and `lastBlockHeight` matches the expected values, and record the `appVersion`
/// in the node state. It then switches to fast sync or consensus and joins the network.
///
/// If Tendermint is unable to retrieve the next chunk after some time
/// (e.g. because no suitable peers are available), it will reject the snapshot
/// and try a different one via `OfferSnapshot`. The application should be prepared
/// to reset and accept it or abort as appropriate.
